## What is it?

A Wordpress theme hacked out of the [HTML5up Eventually Theme](http://html5up.net/) used for http://arganee.world

This was done following [envato tuts+ Creating a WordPress Theme From Static HTML: Preparing the Markup](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/creating-a-wordpress-theme-from-static-html-preparing-the-markup--wp-33895) The dynamic content is generated from the titles of "posts" using the Wordpress API to load via JavaScript (thanks to a hand from [Tom Woodward](http://bionicteaching.com/).
